Meeting 7/9/19:

-we'll make a poster anyway despite not participating to UROC: goal will be to present at SIAM central valley conference (April 2020)
-ask about why removing .simplify() made a big change to M. Bussonnier
-if the data f is the fundamental solution then u us the same. Plot the error instead (OK)
-play with ip widget/volume at some point for make interactive (change M, change k, etc.) Look at previous project if needed.
-separate cells for vizualization (helps not recomputing everything). Three sections: initializations, core, post-processing (OK)
-problem ploting ? When f is a plane wave the result if weird ? ANSWER: it was not a plane wave (but cool idea, just check it is solution of Helmholtz ?) (OK)
-fun exercise: is the plane wave solution of Helmholtz ?
-write properly what we discussed on the board (notations, calculus, etc)
-for interior, "replace" nu by -nu (create another jupyter notebook)


Meeting 7/11/19:
-put all notebooks together (OK)
-question of the BIE interior (is there a -1/2)
-once things are set make a single ipynb with Helmholtz. Called Acoustic scattering maybe ?
-be a little careful with f: (x0,y0) better outside of the computational domain to avoid singularities
-make error plots with the Hankel function for both exterior and interior
for interior: the BIE slightly changes (we can discuss the reason why). 1/2mu becomes -1/2mu. Doesn't need -1/2 apparently.

Meeting 7/16/19:
- exterior Acoustic PTR: error plot ok but seems a bit off. Test with a circle. Error non homogeneous. clues: index issue, error in the expressions? coming np.trapz ? Maybe E_C ?
-talked about the transmission problem, make sure to understand them and start tasks 3,4,5 (take the time to check).
-Dont forget to pull, make changes ,commit, push.

to do for Thursday: investigaer the non uniformity of the error (see questions above ? try to change the source ?maybe the TRUE plane wave)
to do for next Tuesday: talk about the poster


Meeting 7/18/19:
-issue resolved for the error plot: periodicity and np.trapz were the problem
-investigate why trapz makes a difference (bigger error)
-interior: error looks weird, might be an issue the signs
-math issue on the interior acoustic (leave it as is for now), move forward to tasks 3,4


Meeting 7/23/19:
-talked about poster, structure set. To do: a first full draft by Tuesday
-investigate why trapz makes a difference (bigger error)
-interior: error looks weird, might be an issue the signs: ISSUE WITH EIGENVALUES
